Hi!

This is **PyLadiesSG**. We are a non-profitable organisation that aims to *reduce the barrier for ladies to study into computing-related subjects*. 

To achieve this, we are planning to organise workshops to introduce basic computing knowlefge and even physcial activities in the future. 

One thing to take note is that  PyLadiesSG is belong to the international PyLadies and only targeting at females in **Singapore**. <br/> If you are from another country and also interested in PyLadies, you can search for the one at your area.
